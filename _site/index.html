<p>Candice and I first met as roommates in May of 2014. Immediately, we began discussing our LOVE of 'tiny' living. We both watched documentaries, followed blogs and dreamed about one day building our own tiny homes. However, for both of us, actually one day living in a tiny home seemed more like a pipe dream, a fantasy that allowed us to escape from our then day-to-day lives. In addition to our love of tiny homes, we are also in love our neighborhood. We live in the East End of Lexington, Kentucky. This part of town is home to the historic Lyric theatre, the new William Wells Brown elementary school, African American Cemetery No.2, community gardens and a host of other historical sites. It is home to many of the people we have become friends with. Sharing food, jokes, and gardening tips has brought us into closer communion with them.</p>

<p>Living here has also familiarized us with some of the problems facing this area. Its proximity to downtown and inexpensive housing has made the area prime real-estate for developers. As a wealthier pool of lexingtonians grow more and more attracted to the East End, more and more of the longer-term residents find they cannot afford to stay. If some residents do manage to stay, the character of the neighborhood is changing so rapidly that they may one day find themselves alienated from the area that they once knew so well.</p>

<p>Our neighbors are beautiful. They are funny and smart. Some are successful and comfortably middle class. Some are dealing with the effects of severe poverty. Some are dealing with addictions and some are actively engaged in trying to improve this neighborhood everyday. We want the East End to be a place for everyone. One way that we can make that happen is through helping to create space where people can live that is affordable.</p>

<p>However, Simple affordable housing is not our primary goal. We want secure housing to be a foundation upon which people can develop and grow.</p>

<p>Candice and I decided we wanted to bring our ideas about housing (and human potential?) to the progress Lex Unconference. Our idea was voted on by fellow participants and we won. Now we are committed to making a tiny house community in the East End a reality.</P>
