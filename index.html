		Candice and Christine first met as roommates in May of 2014 and since live together at what has lovingly been nick-named Justice House. From the very start, they discussed a shared love for 'tiny' living. Each had watched documentaries, read and followed blogs, and dreamt of one day having a tiny space all their own to call home. As introverted renters in a welcoming (though busy) home, they held onto this fantasy...one that allowed a peaceful and calming escape from day-to-day stressors.

	<p>The Neighborhood</p>
	<p>
		In addition to sharing a passion for tiny homes, Candice and Christine also love their neighborhood and are active in improving their community in the East End of Lexington, Kentucky -- rich with history and home to many infamous sites including the historic Lyric Theatre and Cultural Arts Center Charles Young Community Center, William Wells Brown Elementary School African American Cemetery No.2 in addition to a number of healthy community gardens. They have befriended many neighbors through shared food, jokes, and gardening tips...each exchange bringing them closer and strengthening bonds.

   	Living in the East End has also familiarized the two with challenges facing the area. With such close proximity to downtown, Transylvania University, and North Limestone, inexpensive [often aged and run-down] housing has increased the appeal of flipped real estate and wealthy developers. As affluent Lexingtonians draw closer to East End neighborhoods, more and more native residents are crowded out through increased rents and property taxes. The character and history the neighborhood are at risk if we do not attempt to preserve its diverse identity.

   <p>The Neighbors</p>
   <p>
   	Our neighbors are beautiful and eclectic. They are funny and smart. Some are successful, some are comfortably middle class. Some are struggling with the many impacts of severe poverty. Some are dealing with one or more addiction and some are actively engaged in improving their home and community everyday. The East End is a place for everyone but we must take care and ensure its current residents can still live affordably.

   <p>The Bloom</p>
   <p>
   	With a desire to bring safe and secure housing to more residents of Lexington, Candice and Christine brought their ideas about tiny houses to the ProgressLex Unconference on October 18, 2014. The pitched idea encouraged the inclusion of community, considering the needs of possible tiny house tenants, and personal growth through developing skills and direct building experience. The idea of building momentum around tiny living here in Central Kentucky won --by popular democratic vote. The $500 mini-grant awarded funded our kickoff event, Hygge Homes Presents: Lex Talk Tiny Houses.

   	Affordable housing is one of, but not the primary, goal here. We are a group of people committed to creating a simple, welcoming, tiny house community in the East End. Should you want to encourage tiny homes in your own backyard or neighborhood, you are still invited to partake, share ideas, and learn from our process.
