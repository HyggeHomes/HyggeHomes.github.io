Welcome to our new webpage! Our page was made with the help of LexLadiesCode. These gals meet once a week to spread the joys of coding- in the process increasing the representation of women within the world of web programming. This page will be an ongoing project and with their help will only get better and better.

Check the blog for updates on our shenanigans and the lessons we are learning as we pursue the construction of tiny homes in Lexington.

<h1>It's Coming!</h1>

This Thursday at the Lyric Theatre we will be hosting an informational session on Tiny Homes. This session will include the perspectives of people who live in tiny homes, people who build them, as well as different stakeholders within the city who work on issues of Homelessness. The event will start at 6pm and is free to the public!
